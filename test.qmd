### Transition from R Notebooks and Jupyter:
- If you’re already familiar with R notebooks and Jupyter, this should feel familiar. You’re just writing everything in **one Quarto file** (`.qmd`), where the structure resembles Markdown, and Quarto handles the rendering (e.g., into slides, PDFs, or documents).
  
Would you like to see how you could directly use your R notebook or Jupyter code in Quarto?
