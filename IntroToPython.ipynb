    "\n",
    "- Consistency: Be consistent in how you use markers. If you start using TODO for tasks, stick with it throughout the project.\n",
    "- Clarity: Make your comments clear and concise. The marker should be followed by a brief, but informative description.\n",
    "- Context: Provide enough context in the comment so that someone else (or you in the future) can understand the issue or rationale without needing to read large sections of code.\n",
    "- Prioritization: If possible, indicate the priority or severity of the issue next to the marker.\n",
    "- Integration with Tools: Some IDEs and code quality tools can detect these markers and provide a summary or reminders about them. Leveraging such features can enhance productivity.\n",
    "- Avoid Overuse: While markers can be very useful, overusing them can make your code cluttered and harder to read. Use them judiciously and only where they add value.\n"
